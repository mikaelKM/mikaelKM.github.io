As the world mourns the many deaths from Covid-19,so much seems to pass unnoticed,the 'Black Hand' of the proponents of the New World Order.
  I have previously asked this question,with rare responses of no mundane concerns;If Corona virus is artificially manufactured in a laboratory,who owns this laboratory and what could be the reason behind it?
  The Church and World governments know this and pretty well so,that they are under the watchful eye of the Secret Societies,more specifically,the Jesuit Order.These are highly crafty,meticulous murderers and drunkenly over-domineering  organisations,that control the world.All formidable intelligence agencies,successful banking,insurance,fierce military  organisations are owned and controlled by the Jesuit Order of the Catholic Church.These are sworn satanists,power-hungry,vicious assassins,who push the world agenda in and about everything.No political leader of worth in the world survives without their nod.They finance and orchestrate all major world wars and revolutions.They are dreaded,fathomable and extremely dangerous.
   When the 1720 Plague,the 1820 Cholera Outbreak,the 1920 Spanish Flu and now the 2020 Corona Virus,broke out,no one thought that anybody could be so sinister to trigger such a biological crisis.But,wait a minute,the Jesuits can because they have done it before.
Sometimes,christians make a mistake to believe that all those who exist in the name of the church have anything to do with God.But how wrong they are! A counterfeit form of pseudo-religion(read Christianity) exist among this order and perhaps they don't believe in God.
  The world population,according to the architects of the New World Order is 7 billion plus,a number that is not at par with the biotic holding capacity.A balance need be struck and by all means and this is the guiding principle behind these dreadful souls.
  In laboratory control experiments,a microbe is exposed to starkly opposite conditions,to determine the extent of biotic activity or inactivity.This explains how to contain a microbe and this,the manufacturers of Covid-19 know and have.
   The world must succumb to the evil schemes of Satan through his gullible agents,but one thing is sure,God's Mighty Power will be revealed in a not so long a time.
  SHALOM!

      <b>Why do we need it?</b>  <br>

The world is going mobile and we're consuming more data every year, particularly as the popularity of video and music streaming increases. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns in service, particularly when lots of people in the same area are trying to access online mobile services at the same time.

5G is much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from mobiles to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights.

      </br><b>Will I need a new phone?</b></br>
Yes. But when 4G was introduced in 2009/10, compatible smart phones came onto the market before the infrastructure had been rolled out fully, leading to some frustration amongst consumers who felt they were paying more in subscriptions for a patchy service.

    </br><b>Will it work in rural areas?</b></br>
Lack of signal and low data speeds in rural areas is a common complaint in the UK and many other countries. But 5G won't necessarily address this issue as it will operate on high-frequency bands - to start with at least - that have a lot of capacity but cover shorter distances. 5G will primarily be an urban service for densely populated areas.

Lower-frequency bands (600-800Mhz typically) are better over longer distances, so network operators will concentrate on improving their 4G LTE coverage in parallel with 5G roll-out.

But commercial reality means that for some people in very remote areas, connectivity will still be patchy at best without government subsidy making it worthwhile for network operators to go to these places.
