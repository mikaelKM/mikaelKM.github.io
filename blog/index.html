As the world mourns the many deaths from Covid-19,so much seems to pass unnoticed,the 'Black Hand' of the proponents of the New World Order.
  I have previously asked this question,with rare responses of no mundane concerns;If Corona virus is artificially manufactured in a laboratory,who owns this laboratory and what could be the reason behind it?
  The Church and World governments know this and pretty well so,that they are under the watchful eye of the Secret Societies,more specifically,the Jesuit Order.These are highly crafty,meticulous murderers and drunkenly over-domineering  organisations,that control the world.All formidable intelligence agencies,successful banking,insurance,fierce military  organisations are owned and controlled by the Jesuit Order of the Catholic Church.These are sworn satanists,power-hungry,vicious assassins,who push the world agenda in and about everything.No political leader of worth in the world survives without their nod.They finance and orchestrate all major world wars and revolutions.They are dreaded,fathomable and extremely dangerous.
   When the 1720 Plague,the 1820 Cholera Outbreak,the 1920 Spanish Flu and now the 2020 Corona Virus,broke out,no one thought that anybody could be so sinister to trigger such a biological crisis.But,wait a minute,the Jesuits can because they have done it before.
Sometimes,christians make a mistake to believe that all those who exist in the name of the church have anything to do with God.But how wrong they are! A counterfeit form of pseudo-religion(read Christianity) exist among this order and perhaps they don't believe in God.
  The world population,according to the architects of the New World Order is 7 billion plus,a number that is not at par with the biotic holding capacity.A balance need be struck and by all means and this is the guiding principle behind these dreadful souls.
  In laboratory control experiments,a microbe is exposed to starkly opposite conditions,to determine the extent of biotic activity or inactivity.This explains how to contain a microbe and this,the manufacturers of Covid-19 know and have.
   The world must succumb to the evil schemes of Satan through his gullible agents,but one thing is sure,God's Mighty Power will be revealed in a not so long a time.
  SHALOM!

      <b>Why do we need it?</b>  <br>

The world is going mobile and we're consuming more data every year, particularly as the popularity of video and music streaming increases. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns in service, particularly when lots of people in the same area are trying to access online mobile services at the same time.

5G is much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from mobiles to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights.

      </br><b>Will I need a new phone?</b></br>
Yes. But when 4G was introduced in 2009/10, compatible smart phones came onto the market before the infrastructure had been rolled out fully, leading to some frustration amongst consumers who felt they were paying more in subscriptions for a patchy service.

    </br><b>Will it work in rural areas?</b></br>
Lack of signal and low data speeds in rural areas is a common complaint in the UK and many other countries. But 5G won't necessarily address this issue as it will operate on high-frequency bands - to start with at least - that have a lot of capacity but cover shorter distances. 5G will primarily be an urban service for densely populated areas.

Lower-frequency bands (600-800Mhz typically) are better over longer distances, so network operators will concentrate on improving their 4G LTE coverage in parallel with 5G roll-out.

But commercial reality means that for some people in very remote areas, connectivity will still be patchy at best without government subsidy making it worthwhile for network operators to go to these places.

            <h2 class="display-4">Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
            <h3 class="display-6">Introduction to Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
            <p class="lead">Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that gradually leads to the destruction of a person's memory and the ability to think, eventually leading to difficulties in carrying on simple tasks (Mayo Clinic, 2020). The disease is very common in people with the ages of above sixty. However, there might be a minimal presence of symptoms from the early ages of 30, which are generally rare. Alzheimer's disease is the primary cause of cognitive loss, such as the difficulties in thinking and remembering as well as reasoning among old adults (Mayo Clinic, 2020). Alzheimer's diseases also interfere with the people's behavioral abilities, which significantly impairs the daily life of the individuals by baring the extend to which they can perform everyday duties. Alzheimer's disease has a significant impact on the individual's life, and it puts pressure on the healthcare systems and the economies of countries across the globe, as it's cure has not yet been determined. </p>
             <p class="lead"> The disease was named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer, who, in 1906, performed an autopsy on a woman who died of unusual brain illness, and he noticed some changes in a woman's brain (Alzheimer's Disease Fact Sheet, 2020). The woman suffered from a disease characterized by the loss of memory, challenges in understanding language, and lack of inability to predict events. The doctor examined the woman's brain and noticed abnormal clumps that had developed, and some fiber bundles tangled within the brain (Alzheimer's Disease Fact Sheet, 2020). The Abnormal clumps are currently referred to as Amyloid plaques. The tangles and plaques are presently the characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease. Another common feature of the disease is the connection loss between the different nerve cells, the neurons within the brain (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). The neurons are essential in the transmission of information between the different parts of the brain and from the brain to other body organs (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). It is from the impaired connection between the neurons, which contributes to the impairment in cognition on the patients of Alzheimer's disease.  </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">Causes and patho</h3>
              <p class="lead">The scientists accept that Alzheimer's is caused by a combination of factors such as the environment, a person's lifestyle, and the genetic configurations of an individual (Treatments, 2020). However, there are no known causes of Alzheimer's. But, it is known that some core proteins in the brain generally fail to have standard functionality, disrupting how the brain neurons work unleashing a series of abnormal brain events (What Is Alzheimer's Disease?, 2020). This leads to damage to the neurons, loss of connection between neurons, and death of the brain cells. Usually, the deterioration of the brain neurons seems to start from the fundamental part of the brain responsible for memory. The loss of the neurons in the brain spreads to other parts of the brain in a somewhat predictable pattern, and in the late stages, the brain has a significant shrinkage (What Is Alzheimer's Disease?, 2020). The vital proteins which play a vital role in the development of Alzheimer's disease are plaques and Tangles. </p>
                <p class="lead">  According to Mayo Clinic, (2020), there are different risk factors involved in the development of Alzheimer's diseases such as advanced age, family history and genetics, Down syndrome, sex, and mild cognitive impairments, among others. Older peoples appear to be the most affected by the diseases. The risk of an individual developing Alzheimer's is higher if one of the relatives develop the disease. Also, the variation of the APOE e4 gene seems to increase the risk of getting Alzheimer's, even though it is not a prevalent factor (Mayo Clinic, 2020). The peoples with down syndrome have a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer's diseases. These people have a higher level of developing the plaque gene, which leads to the development of the disease (Mayo Clinic, 2020). Typically, the people with down syndrome have their signs appearing 20 or 10 years earlier, as compared to other people. Even though there is little difference in the risk factors for the development of the disease between men and women, typically, women seem to develop the condition more as compared to men (Mayo Clinic, 2020). The people with mild impairment in cognition show a decline in the thinking and the skills, as compared to ordinary people within the same age. This indicates that such people have a higher risk of developing Dementia, which is one of the most common features of Alzheimer's disease. However, the people dragonized with Mild Cognitive Impairment can adapt to the recommended lifestyle, which significantly compensates for the level of memory loss through great strategies (Mayo Clinic, 2020). </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">Theory About Treatment</h3>
              <p class="lead"> The current medication for Alzheimer's leads to a temporal improvement of the symptoms or slows the rate at which the disease develops in the body. The medication helps people in the maximization of their functioning and maintaining their independence for some time (Treatments, 2020). There are different programs or services that lower the rate of the development of Alzheimer's by offering support to such people and their caregivers (Treatments, 2020).). However, currently, there is no known cure for Alzheimer's disease or treatment. Therefore, the people with the condition develop to advanced stages, which are characterized by dehydration, other infections, or malnutrition, which are essentially complications as a result of severe brain loss (Treatments, 2020). </p>
                <p class="lead">  Once a patient has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease or the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the primary goal becomes the management of the disease to ensure that it does not develop into a critical condition. As there is no cure for the disease, currently, the primary goals for the treatment of the disease include:</p>
                <p class="lead"> 
                  <ul> 
                  <li> Maintaining a high quality of life.</li>
                 <li> Maximization of the daily activity life's functions.</li> 
                 <li> Fostering a safe environment that lowers the rate of the development of the disease.</li> 
               <li> Appropriate Promotion of social engagement.</li>   
                </ul> </p>

           <p class="lead">  The treatment of Alzheimer's disease follows a basic strategy that revolves around maximizing the outcomes of its symptoms. The patients' health conditions and cognition are closely monitored to achieve the expected results (Treatments, 2020). The patient,  their family, and the caregivers are given the appropriate support and education. Also, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments are initiated on the patient and keen evaluation of the patients or the family's motivation towards attending the clinical trials (Treatments, 2020). </p>
           <p class="lead">Most of the clinical trials made by the patients and their families are centered at training the patients the basics of managing their conditions. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of Dementia are the basics areas of concern in the nursing and living facilities involved in the management of Alzheimer's disease (Treatments, 2020). When the patients develop such behaviors like agitation, depression, aggression, or psychosis, they are advised to attend a clinical trial aimed at making their conditions better (Treatments, 2020). The early recognition of the diseases and treatment dramatically reduces the caring cost of the patients with Alzheimer's syndrome as well as improving their quality of life. For these reasons, the patients are being taught to monitor their conditions carefully and seek immediate help from the healthcare systems (Treatments, 2020). </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">How Alzheimer's concept has changed over time</h3>
              <p class="lead">The concept of Alzheimer's disease has significantly changed over time since it was discovered over 100 years ago. The study on the neuropsychological consequences of the disease began in the 1980s (Treatments, 2020). The different basic and translational research which gives different focus on the causes, the characterizations as well as the possible treatments of the disease. 1980 presented a breakthrough in the neuropsychological deficits in which Alzheimer's Disease presented on the individual and which characterized it, particularly from other forms of Dementias (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). In the 1990s, the concept of the cognitive impacts of the disease was put on the timeline and researches about the different cognitive impacts of Alzheimer's on the individuals (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). The efforts in the 1990s produced an explanation of the different cognitive mechanisms which were affected by the various Neurodegenerative abstracts of Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). In the 2000s, the studies about the disease were more concerned with the prodromal stages of the disease before it develops to full brown stages. These are studies on how mild cognitive impairments affect the development of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, imaging and other biomarkers are being put in place to fully characterize preclinical stages of the disease before it develops a more significant decline in cognition (Alzheimer's Association, 2016). Also, potential therapeutic interventions are currently being developed to counter the disease. </p>
                <p class="lead">The gradual conceptualization of Alzheimer's disease is generally aimed at getting appropriate therapeutic procedures of the disease. As the need arises, more research is put in place to solve the effective changes posed from the need for understanding and explaining the different features of this specific form of Dementia (Bondi et al., 2017). It can hence be said that the 1980s formed a period when the cases of Alzheimer's disease increased across the globe, giving aa rise in the need to under the different psychological deficit is presented on the people (Bondi et al., 2017). The concept of the disease grew from knowing least about the disease, to understanding different perspectives of the disease and developing appropriate therapeutic measures for it, in the present. </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">Current western medicine treatment</h3>
              <p class="lead">Multiple therapeutic trials have been made in the disease since it was discovered. The trials are characterized by failed therapies such as anti-inflammatories, hormonal therapies, statins, and chelators  (Waite, 2015). These are drugs that are thought to be promoting the aggregation of the abnormal amyloid betas. Cholinesterase inhibitors are some of the treatment measures thought to be effective therapeutic measures. They work by reduction of neurotransmitter acetylcholine breakdown (Waite, 2015). They make small improvements in the daily activities performed as well as improving the behavioral symptoms (Waite, 2015). Memantine is another form of treatment that is being used in the present. It has a significant effect on cognition and behavior, impacting the ability to perform activities (Waite, 2015). It has been able to lead to a significant reduction of the agitations. However, these treatments, among others, are only providing symptomatic relief for Alzheimer's disease, but with no universal benefits (Waite, 2015). However, the drug trials are promising a cure for the disease soon. </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">Teaching patient how to manage Alzheimer's</h3>
              <p class="lead">After the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the implementation of the treatment is made, the patients are supposed to return to the healthcare systems for the clinical evaluations regularly. The behavioral and cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease tend to change when the ailment progresses (Alzheimer's Disease Fact Sheet, 2020). As the symptoms are dynamic and depend on the progression of the disease, the regular visits to the clinics ensure that appropriate strategies are adapted to the present needs of the disease. However, as the patient with the Dementia cannot keep memories, the family members and caregivers, or a friend are usually encouraged to take care of the patient and accompany them as they choose to visit within the healthcare system (Alzheimer's Disease Fact Sheet, 2020). Visiting the Healthcare centers ensures that the patients can meet their doctors and get the progressive labs done for the progression of the disease also.</p>
                <p class="lead">Also, the patient with Alzheimer's disease is advised to observe alternative options too. The basic ways through which the patient can manage Alzheimer's is having a keen observation of the personality and the behavior changes (Alzheimer's Disease Fact Sheet, 2020). They are required to observe certain risk factors that affect personality behavior and can have a significant influence on the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Usually, Alzheimer's causes some frequent changes in the person's behavior, such as aggressiveness, depression, lack of interest in things, hallucination, walking away from home, and exhibiting unusual sexual behaviors. It needs one to carefully manage their behavior and create a positive impact on Alzheimer's disease. Some of the actions which the patients should observe include, keeping things simple by asking one thing at a time, having a general routine for each day, reassuring the person with the Alzheimer that they are okay and like any other person, the caregivers should be apt and focus on the feelings of such people and showing fewer frustrations when confronted by such people helps in controlling their diseases (Treatments, 2020). Keeping the people with Alzheimer's mind engaged is one of the factors that lower their levels of being frustrated or hallucinating; for this reason, it would be good if one asks them to help in small things. Alzheimer's disease makes the patients experience a behavioral change, which is unusual, and monitoring their behavior or helping them manage it is a great way to manage Alzheimer's disease too (Ricci, 2019). </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">Theoretical perspective</h3>
              <p class="lead">Various theories exist on the causes or the origin of Alzheimer's Disease, as well as the general development or progression of the disease. Theories about the cause of the disease are generally based on findings of the research, which is the abnormal protein formation or accumulation of aluminum within the brains of the patients (Ricci, 2019). Other theories suggest that Alzheimer's is caused by the presence of imbalances of the brain functioning, such as disruption of the calcium. Also, some other approaches are based on the analogies of the other diseases or infection disorders and the genetic systems of the people (Bondi et al., 2017). There is a variant classification of the Alzheimer's Disease subgroup, which indicates that there may be different causes of the disease. However, the genetic explanation of Alzheimer's disease is extensive, and a variety of accounts has been offered to that regard. </p>
                <p class="lead">In the same regard, the theories of human development and cognition can be used in the explanation of the causes of Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's affects people's cognition, and it comes into a human as they advance in ages. For this reason, it suffices to take into consideration the theories of cognitive development (Paget's theory) and the theories of psychological development (Erickson's theory) of the people. The basic principles of Piaget's theory are on the pattern of behavior exhibited or the thoughts. Piaget argues that humans tend to coherently synthesize and combine the processes into a comprehensive system of thought (Mooney, 2013). The organization of cognitive behavior is made to be organized in a particular pattern, which involves the creation of a kind and excellent fit between the conceptions of one's experiences and the realities (Mooney, 2013). The people's cognitive performance is, therefore, significant and is classified in terms of ages, and the external factors, which helps in the definitions of equilibriums and disequilibrium during personal cognitive developments. Essentially, the equilibrium during a particular development is the tendency of organizing a person's cognitive schemes to understand new experiences as they advance in age, while the disequilibrium is the perceived discrepancy between different schemes of human cognition and the further information which leads to the resolving of cognition (Mooney, 2013). As Paget's theories of cognition span the whole of human development, they can be a great tool to explain the explicit different cognitive behavior of the people. </p>
                  <p class="lead">Piaget's theory of pediatrics is used to explain the cognitive development approach of Alzheimer's disease. The observations on the people with Alzheimer's exhibit regression in their behavior have childlike behavior and cognition. The observations are being used in the structuring of clinical research and interventions for the people who have Dementia. The cognitive approach, as suggested by Piaget, demonstrates that people with advanced ages may experience similar characteristics to those of the children (Mooney, 2013). The cognitive functioning of the people can be used in the explanation of the reasons behind the older adults' development of Dementia. Therefore, the cognitive development approach based on Piaget's theories can be used in the understanding of the people who have Alzheimer's disease as well as predicting the requirements for the caregivers. </p>
                    <p class="lead">According to Mooney (2013), the people within the adolescents and the adults exhibit a formal operational stage of cognition. This is the people above the ages of 12. However, the cognitive functioning of the individual does not always get better with the ages as it comes a time, and people experience a deterioration of cognitive functioning (Mooney, 2013). The middle-aged individual has continued cognitive functioning. However, the elderly subjects exhibit lower levels of cognitive functioning as compared to the other groups. As per the Piaget's theory of Patristics, several explanations can be offered regarding the differences in cognitive development based on the ages. Some of the reasons for the degradation of the cognitive functioning of an individual as the age advances include deterioration of the neurons, isolation, insufficiencies in methodologies, and terminal drop (Mooney, 2013). Also, specific demographics such as levels of education, race, and sex can be a cause of cognitive degradation in the old ages. Essentially, these factors which influence cognitive functioning in adulthood demonstrate some of the risk factors for Alzheimer's as argues in other studies. Theoretically, Alzheimer's disease impacts an individual's cognition has close similarities to cognitive development as developed by Piagets, but only being more advanced. This allows us to incorporate the Piaget's defined reasons for cognitive functioning into explaining the behavior of Alzheimer's patients, as they are all of advanced age. </p>
                      <p class="lead">Erickson's theories of psychological development can be a great resource in explaining the different psychological patterns experienced during the development of Alzheimer's disease. Erickson argues that all the people develop through eight stages of psychological development in a particular order from the infancy stage to the adulthood stage (Mooney, 2013). During each step of the development, a person experiences a different psychological crisis, which could have a positive impact or a negative impact on the outcomes of personality development. The psychological crisis places a conflict on the psychological needs and societal needs for human development. When each stage of the development is completed, a healthy personality is developed and other forms of virtues that are basic to an individual (Mooney, 2013). The underlying virtual is the strengths that help an individual in the acquisition of ego that can be used in the resolving of the imposed conflict of needs. If persons fail to complete one of the stages of human development successfully, their abilities to complete other futures stages of the development are reduced, which may be lad to the development of an unhealthy personality. </p>
                        <p class="lead"> When in the childhood stage, one is confronted with such crisis as the Trust versus mistrust, Autonomy versus Shame, initiative versus Quit, and Industry versus Inferiority, while adulthood stage is characterized by crises like Generativity versus Stagnation and ego Integrity versus Despair (Mooney, 2013). This different crisis influences the psychological development of an individual for their entire lifespan. However, it is vaguely based on the crisis resolution and does not explain the explicit occurrence of the developments in the human. Even though the outcomes of one psychological stage has an impact on the development of a later psychological stage, Erickson does not fully explain how the outcome happens.</p>
                          <p class="lead">Erickson's phycological theory of development can be a resourceful tool to be used in the provision of appropriate care for people with Alzheimer's Disease. The people offering care to the patients with Dementia are required to offer exercise to those people with Dementia nullifying the negative factors associated with the particular stage of development a person is to get the positive aspect of the crisis (Mooney, 2013). There should be a continued provision of the activities to the people, which are aimed at facilitating the engagement of the people who have Alzheimer's. However, the activities should not only be aimed at the profession of pleasure or nullification of the negative aspects of the developmental crisis but also addressing the human psychological needs, which are fundamental for them (Mooney, 2013). This gives a breakthrough to a fundamental methodology on how people with Alzheimer's can be engaged in the day to day activities, to improve their health from the psychological perspective. As the people with the Alzheimer's disease continue being altruistic towards the younger generations, the medical staff taking care of the Alzheimer's patients can be trained using the Erickson's theory to effectively provide a conducive environment for those suffering from the disease for a continued sense of meaning as well as the order in their lives. </p>
                            <p class="lead">However, not all the activities are appealing to older people, which is expected that people with Alzheimer's need to be exempted from some of the stimulating activities. The people within the old age bracket need to put aside the need or the thoughts about their future stages and engage in meaningful reflection for their current time. For instance, such people are encouraged to engage in a review of their life or spiritual nourishment. This gives them the perfect mental engagement they need to manage their condition fully (Ricci, 2019). Also, older people are less motivated in making new friends, having engaging relatives who usually confirm their self-identity is an important aspect which can successfully lead to the nourishment of their psychological needs and hence managing their condition. Therefore, it would be significant if the people are family, and close friends are taught on basics for nourishing the basic psychological needs of the people with Dementia. </p>
                              <p class="lead">Erickson's Theories of psychological development and the Piagets theories of Pediatrics offers different perspectives on the disease. While the Piaget's theory can be used in the development of Alzheimer's disease in the cognitive perspective, the Ericksons theory can be used to explain the psychological perspective of the development and the management of the disease. Erickson's theory gives us a change of recommending some old age activities for the management of the psychological crisis, which then allows us to develop a scheme for managing dimensions effectively. The psychological health of the people with Alzheimer's is significant, and it spans into the cognitive functioning of such people. Therefore, as the measures presented to solve the psychological crisis in the old age are put in place, the mechanism also helps the individuals in solving the cognitive functioning impairments. </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">Policy issues in the US.</h3>
              <p class="lead">As the burden of Alzheimer's disease is growing a daily basis and making it not manageable, the united states have been able to develop different policies aimed at reducing the cost of Alzheimer's disease in the future. The united states introduced the National Alzheimer's Project Act as the initial step towards dealing with the economic impact of Alzheimer's (Hoffman, 2014). In conformation with the Act, 33 different states in the united states have put across the advisory groups as well as published unique plans on how coordination will be done to address the Alzheimer's illness within the state levels. The policies are put in place to address dementia illnesses in general and Alzheimer's disease in particular (Hoffman, 2014). The National Alzheimer's Project Act required the different federal agencies, the health care systems, and the caregivers to work in unison in a National Alzheimer's Advisory Council to assess the current state's preparedness and provide a recommendation of the addressing of the present gaps and opportunities for solving Alzheimer's condition (Hoffman, 2014). In line with the Act, a national Alzheimer's plan was developed to address the disease in 2012 (Hoffman, 2014). The primary goal of this plan was to find an effective treatment for the disease, to identify the gaps in the treatment that can be addressed and assess the quality of the healthcare provides in the healthcare system (Hoffman, 2014). </p>

              <p class="lead">The issues of Alzheimer's disease spans from the social aspects of preventing or managing disease to the policy measures put across by various civilizations to help prevent or combat its prevalence in their countries (Hoffman, 2014). In the present, Dementia is affecting more than 47 million individuals across the globe, and the present forecast indicates that it may affect more than 134 million people before 2050 if no better health practices towards its elimination are put in place (Hoffman, 2014). For this reason, it is becoming a significant health concern across the globe, which has no cure but with only medications for the symptoms. The most significant practices taking place across the world rotated around looking for an effective intervention for its prevention or its management, which would reflect in the reduction of both direct and indirect costs incurred during the realm of the disease (Hoffman, 2014). </p>
                <p class="lead">One other country that has been able to address the challenges posed by Alzheimer's Disease in the economy in Italy. Italy has a national plan for Dementia in general, which has leas to the country is getting less impact on Dementia (Hoffman, 2014). The policy suggests the restructuring of the entire health system intending to strengthen the services network as well as the provision of the intervention measures for Alzheimer's and support for the caregivers and families (Hoffman, 2014). Besides the systematic approach to Alzheimer's, the policy is also requiring more research nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments. This helps in the delaying of the loss of the self-sufficiency measures and significantly impacts the health and the social cost of the disease (Hoffman, 2014). </p>
              <h3 class="display-6">Conclusion</h3>
              <p class="lead">Alzheimer's disease seems to have put pressure on the healthcare systems as well as in the economies of the countries. 	It is significantly increasing across the globe, and its cost, both direct and indirect, is currently high. There is no apparent cure known for it expect the symptomatic medications. This makes it put pressure on the economy as only the management measures are known and are being put in place by the health caregivers. These management procedures are defined to counter the symptoms or to counter the progression of the disease. Also, they are made to suitably fit in the psychological and the cognitive-developmental theoretical approaches of the disease. Even though the psychological and cognitive theories do not explicitly explain the development of the disease, the management measures put across to counter the disease, seem to be effective. However, further research is recommended that leads to the development of better management measures and policies for the treatment or management of the disease. </p>
